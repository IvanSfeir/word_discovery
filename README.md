# word_discovery

In this repository I gather all the files I used during my masters project in the GETALP research group.

-- modifications_seq2seq folder

In this folder I include the files I changed in the seq2seq model implemented by Alexandre BÃ©rard and available in https://github.com/eske/seq2seq. I also include a modifications_log.md file, in which I describe the exact changes made by me.

-- visualization folder

The scripts in this file are used to generate the loss and BLEU score curves, using the output generated by the seq2seq model. Order of execution:

1) rnnLogFileParser.py receives the training log from the network, and create a .out file.

2) createGraphics.r uses this .out file to generate the graphics.
