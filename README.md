# Unsupervised Word Discovery Using Encoder-Decoder Neural Machine Translation Models

This repository is passing through heavy changes. :)


# visualization folder

For visualizing loss and bleu score behavior during training. There is an example file of the log format, called "example.txt".

1) __python logFileParser.py <FILE-NAME.txt>__ (generates a file called "FILE-NAME.out")

2) __Rscript --vanilla createGraphics.r <FILE-NAME.out> <IMAGES-PATH>__ (generates "lossPlot.png" and "bleuPlot.png", it needs ggplot2)
